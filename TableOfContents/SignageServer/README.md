## Home Signage Servers

Often you can create a server version of something you'd like to display on a wall display at home, and then use a raspberry pi to connect to that webpage on boot automatically. You can use this set of instructions, and just substitute out the dakboard specific elements, and use it to setup a raspberry pi to connect automatically to one of your running dashboard/signage containers' URLs.
