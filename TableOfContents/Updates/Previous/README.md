# Previous Updates:

Added more items from various other portainer templates, and catagorized based on my own needs, after searching the forks from Qballjos.

I would also like to eventually add the following container templates in the future:

    Vikunja (*Added Config and Stack Yaml File, with IP and Port configuration. It seems to be working. I will add DB, etc, variables at a later time, as it's set to stack defaults for now (from the official stack documentation) )

    Joplin (*Added Config and Stack Yaml File, with IURL and Port configuration. It seems to be working. I will add DB, etc, variables at a later time, as it's set to stack defaults for now (from the official stack documentation) )

    Kavita (Added Config, after reviewing docker setup notes)

    Koomga (Added Config, after reviewing docker setup notes)

    MagicMirror2 (Added Config, after reviewing docker setup notes)

    Readarr (Added Config, after reviewing docker setup notes)

    Rocket.Chat (*Added Config and Stack Yaml File. It seems to be working. I will add variables at a later time, as it's set to stack defaults for now (from the official stack documentation))

    Habitica

    Traefik

Further to the above, Catagory Placement work will be on-going...Some images will also be updated, and the code formatting will be adjusted for cleanliness... I feel tired already... hahaha
