# What do I need and how do I Self-Host?

All you really need to Self-Host is an extra PC that you leave turned on and connected to your nextwork at home. On the Older PC you will install Proxmox, and Proxmox will allow you to use all the hardware in your older machine for a number of little servers, as virtual machines or containers, instead of needing a large number segregated machines. 

#### Roughly Speaking, the initial setup steps to self-host will generally follow these steps: 

- Install Proxmox on your extra PC
- Configure Proxmox during the installation process 
- Confirm you can connect to Proxmox via the Browser on your main PC
- Do the Post-Install configuration steps 
- Setup required containers and VMs for all the services you want to host, as your hardware allows
- Install the required services in your VMs and Containers 
- Test the Services you setup
- Enjoy your services, have fun and expand your system over time!

Further notes will be added at a later time to help beginners on their path to Self-Hosting :)
