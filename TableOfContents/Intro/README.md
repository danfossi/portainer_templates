# What is Self-Hosting? 

We are going to look at the definition in two steps to make it easier ;) 

First, let's define *Externally*-Hosted Services by looking at a few examples: 

* Google's Search Engine
* Microsoft Teams
* Skype
* A Friend's Media Server
* Steam

Okay, Second, let's add in the idea of self hosted:

Instead of using services run by other people, or corperate groups, which you may even *Pay* for, you have a computer at home that *Serves* up these services for you. 
This Computer acts as your *Server* and instead of other groups controlling your data, or charging you for hosting, etc, you control how things are used and accessed, along with miniminal cost (comparatively speaking).

# What do I need and how do I Self-Host?

All you really need to Self-Host is an extra PC that you leave turned on and connected to your nextwork at home. 

On the Older PC you will install Proxmox, and Proxmox will allow you to use all the hardware in your older machine for a number of little servers, as virtual machines or containers, instead of needing a large number segregated machines. 

#### Roughly Speaking, the initial setup steps to self-host will generally follow these steps: 

- Install Proxmox on your extra PC
- Configure Proxmox during the installation process 
- Confirm you can connect to Proxmox via the Browser on your main PC
- Do the Post-Install configuration steps 
- Setup required containers and VMs for all the services you want to host, as your hardware allows
- Install the required services in your VMs and Containers 
- Test the Services you setup
- Enjoy your services, have fun and expand your system over time!

Further notes will be added at a later time to help beginners on their path to Self-Hosting :)
