# What do I need and how do I Self-Host?

All you really need to Self-Host is a PC that you leave turned on and connected to your nextwork at home. An Older PC will do, but, basically, the initial setup steps to self-host will generally follow these steps: 

- Install Proxmox on your extra PC
- Configure Proxmox during the installation process 
- Confirm you can connect to Proxmox via the Browser on your main PC
- Do the Post-Install configuration steps 
- Setup required containers and VMs for all the survices you want to host, as your hardware allows
- Install the required services in your VMs and Containers 
- Test the Services you setup
- Enjoy your services, have fun and expand your system over time!

Further notes will be added at a later time to help beginners on their path to Self-Hosting :)
