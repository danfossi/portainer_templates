## Brand New Updates:

#### 6/24/2022 - Added a Windows 11 section for Debloating apps, etc

#### 6/15/2022 - Added Pwndrop, Authentik, and Apprise-API. All code was obtained from the already noted template lists. Xneo1 and technorabilia. Future notations additions from other templates will just feature the template list I created. If a new template was used as a source it will be added and noted, however. 

#### 6/14/2022 - I've added the MeshCentral Docker Image by: gurucomputing to the Portainer Template. 

#### 6/14/2022 - I've added the Dockerholics Github Repo link to the Self-Hosting Links section.
